# Bike-sales-analysis-dashboard
I'm excited to present a bike sales analysis dashboard I created using Microsoft Excel. In this project, I applied various techniques such as find & replace, removing duplicates, addressing missing values, converting continuous data into categorical using nested IF statements, and leveraging pivot tables and charts for visualization.

Key insights from the analysis:

Customers aged between 31 and 54 purchased the highest number of bikes.
Singles bought more bikes compared to married individuals.
Buyers in Europe with higher average salaries purchased more bikes than in other regions.
